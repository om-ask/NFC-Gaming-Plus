class PointsManager:
    """
    A class that manages user visits and point allocations using the PointsRepo.

    The PointsManager interacts with the PointsRepo class to handle business logic
    related to user visits to specific places and the calculation and assignment of points.

    This class is responsible for verifying the existence of users and places, 
    ensuring no duplicate visits, and calculating the points awarded for each visit.

    Attributes:
        PointsRepo (PointsRepo): An instance of the PointsRepo class that manages interactions with the database.

    Methods:
        recordVisit(userId: str, readerId: str) -> None:
            Records a visit by a user to a particular place, checking for validity and awarding points.

        _checkIfUserExists(userId: str) -> bool:
            Checks if the user exists in the PointsRepo database.

        _checkIfReaderExists(readerId: str) -> bool:
            Checks if the reader (place) exists in the PointsRepo database.

        _checkIfVisitExists(userId: str, readerId: str) -> bool:
            Checks if the user has already visited the specified place.

        _calculatePoints(readerId: str) -> int:
            Calculates the points to be awarded for visiting the specified place.

        _addPoints(userId: str, readerId: str, points: int) -> None:
            Adds points to the user's account in the PointsRepo database.
